## Developing üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

Idea is to create a teachers recruitment management system that is highly scalable and will be used for the entire duration of the tenure. A web app that helps teachers to keep track of their govt exam notifications and is responsible for their recruitment process. It will monitor the beneficiary till the provided tenure of his job.

We are developing a centralized recruitment system for teachers to keep full track of their entire service duration which is being done manually which makes it difficult to manage . Addressing this problem we will give the government the ease of managing teachers through our one single portal (Edu Recruit) which will help in maintaining clear stats of the teachers currently posted.
